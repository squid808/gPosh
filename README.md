# Welcome to gPosh!

## What is gPosh?
gPosh is a work in progress. It aims to take all of the Google APIs available via the [Google Discovery APIs](https://developers.google.com/discovery/) and create a working PowerShell wrapper using the [gShell core pieces](https://github.com/squid808/gShell) (for authentication and token storage) and the [Google APIs Client Generator](https://github.com/google/apis-client-generator).

Wish me luck :)

Please reach out if you have any questions, concerns or requests.
